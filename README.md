# Spaceship-Titanic

This analysis aims to assist rescue teams in locating the missing passengers who were initially onboard the spaceship but ended up in an alternate dimension due to a space anomaly. We obtained passenger records from the damaged computer system and developed models utilizing four Machine Learning algorithms: Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN). The highest accuracy, reaching 95%, was attained through an ensemble learning approach with Random Forest.
